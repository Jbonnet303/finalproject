Summary:
This website teaches beginner billiards players to become as good as the pros. Just follow the easy steps and practice breaking and running the table.

Built with:
Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, CSS, HTML.

Overcoming obstacles:
Going back and relearning passed material was probably the biggest obstacle that I was able to overcome. Commiting a large part of time looking at notes defiantily had me worried but, in the end I was able to focus on specific parts and tackle each section one by one. 

Future design:
Add a "Reviews" Section. Add an option to learn 9ball. Also add a login access.
